# SALES-MEDIA-ANALYTICS
So, this project is a Social Media Analytics Dashboard that I built to simulate a real-world scenario where a marketing team or a brand manager would need to track performance across multiple social media platforms. The idea came from the growing importance of data-driven marketing strategies, where brands use data to optimize their campaigns and engagement."

Dataset Creation:

"Since this is a portfolio project, I designed the dataset myself to reflect realistic social media data. It includes key metrics such as:

"Reach: How many unique users saw the content."

"Impressions: Total views including repeated views."

"Engagements: Likes, shares, comments, etc."

"Clicks: Click-through actions from posts."

"Followers: Cumulative followers over time."

"Post types and platforms: Like Text, Video, Inâ†“

I created around 500 rows of data to ensure it's large enough to simulate business-level reporting but still manageable for a dashboard demo."

Purpose of the Project:

"The goal was to enable clear insights into:

"How each platform is performing."

"Which post types generate the most engagement."

"Trends over time in reach, followers, and engagements."

"The relationship between impressions and clicks."
